# Wafer Fault Detection Project Architecture
# 1. Overview
The Wafer Fault Detection system aims to classify wafers as faulty or non-faulty using machine learning techniques. The system involves several stages from data ingestion to model deployment.

# 2. System Components
2.1 Data Ingestion
Description: Responsible for acquiring raw data from the source.
Input: Raw wafer images or data.
Output: Processed data for validation and transformation.
Tools: Custom scripts or ETL tools.

2.2 Data Validation
Description: Ensures the data meets quality standards and is free from errors.
Input: Raw data.
Output: Validated and cleaned data.
Tools: Python scripts for validation checks.

2.3 Data Transformation
Description: Transforms raw data into a suitable format for analysis and modeling.
Input: Validated data.
Output: Transformed data.
Tools: Pandas, NumPy.

2.4 Model Training
Description: Involves training machine learning models on the transformed data.
Input: Transformed training data.
Output: Trained models.
Tools: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

2.5 Model Evaluation
Description: Evaluates model performance using metrics and validation techniques.
Input: Trained models, test data.
Output: Model evaluation metrics and the best-performing model.
Tools: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for visualizing metrics).

2.6 Prediction
Description: Uses the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.
Input: New wafer data.
Output: Fault classification results.
Tools: Model inference scripts.

2.7 Logging
Description: Captures logs for tracking the process and debugging issues.
Input: System activities and errors.
Output: Log files.
Tools: Python logging module.

Raw Data Ingestion → Data Validation → Data Transformation → Training and Test Data → Model Training → Model Evaluation → Best Model → Prediction
Logging operates parallel to all stages to capture and record system activities.
